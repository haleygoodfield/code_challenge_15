# Risk Management Dashboard
This is my fifteenth coding challenge using JavaScript. Here, I will apply my skills in DOM manipulation to dynamically add, update, and remove risk assessments to create an interactive **Risk Management Dashboard** that helps businesses assess and manage various risks.
This scenario will be split into 6 Tasks: 
+ Task 1: Creating the Base Structure
+ Task 2: Adding Risk Items Dynamically
+ Task 3: Removing Risk Items
+ Task 4: Categorizing Risks by Level
+ Task 5: Implementing Bulk Updates
+ Task 6: Handling Event Propagation
